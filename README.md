Along with increasing internet access in society, more and more sectors of life are venturing into the online world. No exception trade sector or buying and selling. This can be proven by the rapid growth of buying and selling sites today.

The number of buying and selling sites that are so many and compete with each other makes every site owner company try to maintain the loyalty of its customers. Circumstances in which a customer stops using a company's services is called churn.

The dataset to be analyzed is customer data who started creating accounts on a buying and selling site from 2015-2017.

To minimize customer churn, companies need to create a model that can predict whether a customer will churn or not. If the predicted result of the model is churn, the company needs to take anticipatory steps so that the customer does not actually become churn in the real world.
